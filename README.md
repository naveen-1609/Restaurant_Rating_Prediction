## Overview
This is a Flask web app which predicts fare of Flight ticket.

## Motivation
I am really facinated about Data Science, This is my first End-to-End Data Science project. It may not be the the best one, but I have learnt a lot. This pandamic really helped me to choose a right career option. The first video which I watched about data science really introduced me to Data Science world and that is when I have set DS as my career goal. I really struggled in the beginning but eventually I took my time to get confortable and slowly I started loving the challenges which I felt intimidating at first.
